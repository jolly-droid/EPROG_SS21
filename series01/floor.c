/*
 * he floor function is the function that takes as input a real number and gives as outputthe greatest integer less than or equal to it.
 * For positive numbers, an implementation of this function can be obtained via the type casting from double to int.
 * Write a program, which reads a positive number x >0 from the keyboard, evaluates the floor function, and prints the result to the screen.
 * This approach does not work for negative numbers. Why? Save your source code asfloor.cinto the directoryserie01
